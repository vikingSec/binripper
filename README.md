An integrated malware analysis and reverse engineering platform

I've committed to this being a native app built in Rust's [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/). I'm working on figuring out just how to stitch the backend and frontend together. It may end up being joined into a single package, but I'm not entirely sure.
